### Assignment
The assignment of this project is to create an algorithm within python that generates a train lining system that optimizes the overall quality of the lining system. This can be done by maximizing the objective function given in the excercise.

### Method
The methods and algorithms which are used to create a solution are described in the README.md files in the "part" folders.

### Prerequisites
The code is fully written in python. The file 'requirements.txt' contains all packages to run the progrem succesfully. These packages are easy installable with the following instruction:
<pre> pip install -r requirements.txt </pre>

### Testing
To run the code, use the following instruction:
<pre> python code.py </pre>
