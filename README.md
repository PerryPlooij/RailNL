# RailNL
This Readme.md gives a short explanation about the RailNL case.

## Getting Started

#### Assignment
The assignment of this project is to create an algorithm within python that generates a train lining system for intercity trains that optimizes the overall quality of the train lining system. This can be done by maximizing the objective function given in the excercise. The objective function can be described as follows: K = p * 10000 - (T * 100 + Min). There are two conditions that have to be met when creating a train lining system. The first one is that a pathway has a maximum time length and the second condition is that a train lining system has a maximum number of pathways.

#### Method
The methods and heu which are used to create a solution are described in the README.md files in the "part/code" folders.

#### Prerequisites
The code is fully written in python. The file 'requirements.txt' contains all packages to run the progrem succesfully. These packages are easy installable with the following instruction:
<pre> pip install -r requirements.txt </pre>

#### Testing
To run the code, use the following instruction:
<pre> python main.py </pre>


#### Attachment
The attachment folder contains files we received from the minor to get things started.
